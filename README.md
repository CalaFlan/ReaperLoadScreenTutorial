# ReaperLoadScreenTutorial
A extension to run on reaper loading, that displays a random reaper tip/trick

all tips in the .txt have been gathered from my own experience, the reaper user manual (which i recommended reading) or by Reaper users who have taken their time to share the tips publicly. as such I claim no ownership over the tips and you are free to use them however you please.

no generative AI has been used in the creation of the script or tips. (for proof look for my many spelling mistaks)
